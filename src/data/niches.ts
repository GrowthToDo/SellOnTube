        question: 'Is YouTube worth it for SaaS with a low ACV?',
        answer: "The honest answer depends on which queries you target. A $99/month tool with 12-month average retention is worth around $1,200 per customer. If a video costs $600 to produce and brings in two retained customers during its first year, you're already positive before month six. And the video keeps running after that. The trap with low ACV isn't the YouTube ROI calculation. It's spending the production budget on educational content that attracts people learning about your category instead of people deciding which tool to buy. We focus only on bottom-of-funnel queries where the viewer is close to signing up.",
      },
      {
        question: 'How long until we see signups from YouTube?',
        answer: "For low-competition queries, first traction typically appears within 4 to 8 weeks of publishing. The more meaningful shift, where multiple videos are ranking and driving consistent volume together, usually happens around months 4 to 6. If you need leads in the next 30 days, run paid ads in parallel while you build. YouTube is a different kind of investment: slower to start, and much harder to stop once it's working.",

        question: 'Do we need to show our faces on camera?',

YouTube is more durable, not because of some algorithm advantage, but because you cannot reduce a 12-minute software comparison video to three bullet points. The compounding logic also works differently: a video that starts ranking in month one still drives signups in month 18.",
